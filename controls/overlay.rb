  who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or
  write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object
  or via specified ownership assignment.

      DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they
  control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC
  models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit,
  resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

      When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the
  application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

      The DBMS must ensure the recipient of permissions possesses only the access
  intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit rights propagation if
  that is the intent of the grantor. If the propagation of access rights is not
  limited, users with rights to objects they do not own can continue to grant
  rights to those objects to other users without limit.

  desc "Anytime an authentication method is exposed,  to allow for the
  utilization of an application, there is a risk that attempts will be made to
  obtain unauthorized access.

      To defeat these attempts, organizations define the number of times a user
  account may consecutively fail a logon attempt. The organization also defines
  the period of time in which these consecutive failed attempts may occur.

      By limiting the number of failed logon attempts, the risk of unauthorized
  system access via user password guessing, otherwise known as brute forcing, is
  reduced. Limits are imposed by locking the account.

      More recent brute force attacks make attempts over long periods of time to
  circumvent intrusion detection systems and system account lockouts based
  entirely on the number of failed logons that are typically reset after a
  successful logon.

  title "The DBMS must support organizational requirements to enforce the

  desc  "Passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals.

    If the information system or application allows the user to consecutively
  reuse extensive portions of their password when they change their password, the
  end result is a password that has not had enough elements changed to meet the
  policy requirements.

      Changing passwords frequently can thwart password-guessing attempts or
  re-establish protection of a compromised DBMS account. Minor changes to
  passwords may not accomplish this since password guessing may be able to
  continue to build on previous guesses, or the new password may be easily
  guessed using the old password.

      Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an
  enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level
  authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active
  Directory and LDAP  This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to
  have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

  network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network.

      The act of managing systems and applications includes the ability to access

  diagnostic information, user information, and potentially sensitive application
  data.

      When applications provide a remote management capability inherent to the
  application, the application needs to ensure all sessions and network
  connections are terminated when non-local maintenance is completed.

      When network connections are left open after the database session has
  closed, the network session is open to session hijacking.

      The Oracle Listener inherently meets most of this SRG requirement.  When a
  user logs off, or times out, or encounters an unrecoverable network fault, the
  Oracle Listener terminates all sessions and network connections.  The remaining
  aspect of the requirement, the timeout because of inactivity, is configurable.
