  who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or
  write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object
  or via specified ownership assignment.

      DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they
  control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC
  models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit,
  resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

      When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the
  application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

      The DBMS must ensure the recipient of permissions possesses only the access
  intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit rights propagation if
  that is the intent of the grantor. If the propagation of access rights is not
  limited, users with rights to objects they do not own can continue to grant
  rights to those objects to other users without limit.

  requirements and help protect accounts from password guessing attempts.

      Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an
  enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level
  authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active
  Directory and LDAP. This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to
  have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

  tag "check": "If all user accounts are authenticated by the OS or an
  enterprise-level authentication/access mechanism, and not by Oracle, this is
  not a finding.

  For each profile that can be applied to accounts where authentication is under
  Oracle's control, determine the password reuse rule, if any, that is in effect:
  SELECT * FROM SYS.DBA_PROFILES
  WHERE RESOURCE_NAME IN ('PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX', 'PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME')
  [AND PROFILE NOT IN (<list of non-applicable profiles>)]
  ORDER BY PROFILE, RESOURCE_NAME;
  Bearing in mind that a profile can inherit from another profile, and the root
  profile is called DEFAULT, determine the value of the PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX
  effective for each profile.

  If, for any profile, the PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX value does not enforce the
  DoD-defined minimum number of password changes before a password may be
  repeated (five or greater), this is a finding.

  PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX is effective if and only if PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME is
  specified, so if both are UNLIMITED, this is a finding."
  tag "fix": "If all user accounts are authenticated by the OS or an

  If any user accounts are managed by Oracle:  For each profile, set the

  changes before a password may be repeated (five or greater).

  PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX is effective if and only if PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME is

  password lifetime is 1 day, the smallest meaningful value is the same as the
  PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX value.
