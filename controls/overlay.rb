  who should be authorized to access the object and in which mode (e.g., read or
  write). Ownership is usually acquired as a consequence of creating the object
  or via specified ownership assignment.

      DAC allows the owner to determine who will have access to objects they
  control. An example of DAC includes user-controlled file permissions. DAC
  models have the potential for the access controls to propagate without limit,
  resulting in unauthorized access to said objects.

      When applications provide a discretionary access control mechanism, the
  application must be able to limit the propagation of those access rights.

      The DBMS must ensure the recipient of permissions possesses only the access
  intended. The database must enforce the ability to limit rights propagation if
  that is the intent of the grantor. If the propagation of access rights is not
  limited, users with rights to objects they do not own can continue to grant
  rights to those objects to other users without limit.

      Note that user authentication and account management must be done via an
  enterprise-wide mechanism whenever possible.  Examples of enterprise-level
  authentication/access mechanisms include, but are not limited to, Active
  Directory and LDAP. This requirement applies to cases where it is necessary to
  have accounts directly managed by Oracle.

  desc  "Password maximum lifetime is  the maximum period of time, (typically
in days) a user's password may be in effect before the user is forced to change
it.

    Passwords need to be changed at specific policy-based intervals as per
policy. Any password, no matter how complex, can eventually be cracked.

    One method of minimizing this risk is to use complex passwords and
periodically change them. If the application does not limit the lifetime of
passwords and force users to change their passwords, there is the risk that the
system and/or application passwords could be compromised.

    DBMS default passwords provide a commonly known and exploited means for
unauthorized access to database installations.
